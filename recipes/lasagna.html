    <strong><em>"A fabulous dish with old school flavours"</em></strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        "Filling and easy to make, lasagnas are great one-dish meals that check all the boxes, as they can be filled with all sorts of veggies, sauces, and proteins, and can be adjusted to many special dietary needs. Our red and white sauce lasagna is a flavorful combination of a basic white sauce, rather than ricotta cheese, and a tomato-based sauce with beef and pork that's flavored with spices and mushrooms. Covered in cheese and baked until golden, this is a great weeknight meal served with a simple salad and crusty bread."

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4>Make The White Sauce</h4>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.</li>
            <li>Warm up the milk in a small saucepan, but don't let it boil.</li>
            <li>Add the flour to the melted butter and stir to form a roux. Cook for about two minutes.</li>
            <li>Slowly whisk in the warm milk, stirring well to get rid of any flour lumps. Season with kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and reserve, covered.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4>Make The Red Sauce</h4>
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat up the olive oil and add the ground beef and pork.</li>
        <li>Cook until all the meat is well browned, approximately 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain excess fat from the meat, reserving 2 tablespoons in the skillet, and remove the meat mixture from the pan. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onion to the skillet with the reserved fat and saut√© until translucent, for about 6 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and garlic to the skillet and cook until the mushrooms are soft, or 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the meat to the pan and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce and dried herbs to the meat, garlic, and onions. Stir well.</li>
        <li> Bring the meat sauce to a simmer and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the red sauce from heat and season to taste with kosher salt and black pepper.</li>

    </ol>
</p>

    <p>
        <h4>Assemble the Lasagna</h4>
    </p>

    <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F. In a 3-quart ovenproof baking dish, ladle enough of the red meat sauce to cover the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
    <li>Arrange a layer of pasta atop the red meat sauce and then another layer of red sauce.</li>
    <li>Drizzle roughly 1/3 of the white sauce evenly atop the red sauce. </li>
    <li>Repeat the previous step twice by layering layers of pasta, red sauce, and white sauce.</li>
    <li>Spread the shredded mozzarella on top of the final white sauce layer.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the grated Parmesan on top of the mozzarella.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
    <li> After 40 minutes, remove foil and bake for about 10 more minutes, or until the cheese on top has browned slightly. Remove lasagna from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    
    </ol>
