        "Pan-fried salmon steak is a delicacy when seasoned with sage and cooked in butter. It's a delicious and seemingly fancy restaurant-level dish that is in fact very easy to prepare, making it the ideal choice for a weeknight dinner."

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 salmon steaks, skin on, bones removed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 lemons</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200C.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the lemons into a dish large enough to fit both salmon steaks, then add the soy sauce. Place salmon in prepared dish. Turn it over once to ensure an even coating of the marinade.</li>
            <li>Place each salmon steak into a separate tin foil sheet and create a rectangular shape around the base of the salmon with the foil. The purpose of this step is to ensure that a large amount of the marinade can be drizzled over the salmon steak so it has a 'poaching effect' when baking. This ensures that the meat is tender whilst still being cooked through.</li>
            <li>Put enough marinade inside the foil with the salmon steak to cover at least half a centimetre of the base. Then finish wrapping the tin foil over the top of each steak so they are both completely covered.</li>
            <li>Place the tin foil-covered steaks onto an oven tray and bake for approximately 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the salmon steaks out of the tin foil and serve with or without a dash of the marinade remaining inside the foil. </li>
        </ol>
